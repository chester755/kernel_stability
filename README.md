# kernel_stability
In my final stage of my PhD, my linux kernel just crash and my SSD is ruined. This project aims to improve the overall stability of the Linux kernel to different hardware and software change. As a lot of operation could potentially damage the system even the hardware. 

Roadmap to achieve it:

Stage.1 Understand the entire kernel source code.

Stage.2 Modify the current distribution system.

Stage.3 Small package that checks the system integrity daily (lightweight).

Stage.4 Optimisation.
